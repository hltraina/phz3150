Continued this log for Homework 2. 
Took a screenshot of Jupyter after downloading the Anaconda installation from class Tuesday, August 29. My Jupyter Notebook currently runs Python version 3.
I also took a screenshot of my Github desktop 
Problem 2: 
The dog loves eating food; his owner; and other dogs,
The dog loves eating his owner and other dogs. 
Natural languages, contrary to programming languages, are far more susceptible to evolution and change with usage. 
Programming languages, while still may be susceptible to evolution and change, are often determined by few programmers to remain unambigious.
Furthermore, natural languages have tons of rules for binding pronouns and often make statments abstract, which programming language strives to avoid. 
Problem 3:
Completed the Hello World tutorial on Github, too screenshots and saved to folder.

Reopened this log to work on the third homework assignment. Set up a repository within the class folder to complete the assignment.
Created the Jupyter log and completed problems 1 - 3. 
As I pushed origin in Github, an extra folder was created within my homework 3 folder. It was a test_git folder where there is a file that is a duplicate of my homework 3 file.
The extra file was a "checkpoint" file. When I first went to commit changes, there was a warning message pertaining the survey log; however, I chose to do it anyways and that's how the checkpoint file came to be.
Created a Zipfile with screenshots and log to submit for the assignment.

Opened a new file in Jupyter and created a separate file called "acceleration.py"
Struggled with loading the separate file into the homework 4 doc
Ran the acceleration function in a not separate file and the code worked, just had issues with importing it
After lots of trial and error, my function ended up working!
Tested my numbers with this website: https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/acceleration
Pushed my files on GitHub and created a zip file to submit!

Created new file and pushed it from origin.
Created a function to solve for roots using the quadratic formula, tested it using an online calculator to confirm results.
Struggled with inputting list values for question 2
Created a displacement funciton that ran smoothly!
Double checked values using: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/displacement_v_a_t.php

Created the Homework 6 folder and kernel. 
Completed Problem 1 and created a graph. Struggled with adjusting the size of the line. 
Completed Problem 2. Bright was not one of the words featured in the question so did not include it in my code. 
Defined the dictionary for problem 3. 
Pushed on GitHub to origin!
