Natural languages, contrary to programming languages, are far more susceptible to evolution and change with usage. 
Programming languages, while still may be susceptible to evolution and change, are often determined by few programmers to remain unambigious.
Furthermore, natural languages have tons of rules for binding pronouns and often make statments abstract, which programming language strives to avoid. 
Problem 3:
Completed the Hello World tutorial on Github, too screenshots and saved to folder.
