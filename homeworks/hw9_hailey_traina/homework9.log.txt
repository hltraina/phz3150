A: I have programmed a few games and crunched statistics, but do not have lots of experience.
Q: In what language(s)?
A: I programmed a few games in C my first year. Now, I use R mainly for statistics but have little experience in Python.
Summarize your experience:
Q: Have you taken statistics or probability?
A: I am a Statistics major so I have taken numerous statistics and probability courses.
Q: Why are you taking this course?
A: I am taking this course to get a better understanding of Python and use it to program more outside of Statistics.
Q: Are there particular topics you hope to learn?
A: I hope to get more comfortable with Python applications and learn the basics so I can become more comfortable with developing Python programs.
Q: If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly describe your experience:
A: In Statistics, I have created tons of models based on a particular sample of data.
Q: Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar? If so,describe:
A: I have not gotten involved with a science club, but I hope to one day go into Meteorology.

Continued this log for Homework 2. 
Took a screenshot of Jupyter after downloading the Anaconda installation from class Tuesday, August 29. My Jupyter Notebook currently runs Python version 3.
I also took a screenshot of my Github desktop 
Problem 2: 
The dog loves eating food; his owner; and other dogs,
The dog loves eating his owner and other dogs. 
Natural languages, contrary to programming languages, are far more susceptible to evolution and change with usage. 
Programming languages, while still may be susceptible to evolution and change, are often determined by few programmers to remain unambigious.
Furthermore, natural languages have tons of rules for binding pronouns and often make statments abstract, which programming language strives to avoid. 
Problem 3:
Completed the Hello World tutorial on Github, too screenshots and saved to folder.

Reopened this log to work on the third homework assignment. Set up a repository within the class folder to complete the assignment.
Created the Jupyter log and completed problems 1 - 3. 
As I pushed origin in Github, an extra folder was created within my homework 3 folder. It was a test_git folder where there is a file that is a duplicate of my homework 3 file.
The extra file was a "checkpoint" file. When I first went to commit changes, there was a warning message pertaining the survey log; however, I chose to do it anyways and that's how the checkpoint file came to be.
Created a Zipfile with screenshots and log to submit for the assignment.

Opened a new file in Jupyter and created a separate file called "acceleration.py"
Struggled with loading the separate file into the homework 4 doc
Ran the acceleration function in a not separate file and the code worked, just had issues with importing it
After lots of trial and error, my function ended up working!
Tested my numbers with this website: https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/acceleration
Pushed my files on GitHub and created a zip file to submit!

Created new file and pushed it from origin.
Created a function to solve for roots using the quadratic formula, tested it using an online calculator to confirm results.
Struggled with inputting list values for question 2
Created a displacement funciton that ran smoothly!
Double checked values using: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/displacement_v_a_t.php

Created the Homework 6 folder and kernel. 
Completed Problem 1 and created a graph. Struggled with adjusting the size of the line. 
Completed Problem 2. Bright was not one of the words featured in the question so did not include it in my code. 
Defined the dictionary for problem 3. 
Pushed on GitHub to origin!

Created the Homework 7 folder and kernel.
Using the previous lecture, found an example similar to the for loop for part 1 of problem 1.
Struggled with formatting the while loop for a bit. The code kept returning "developer" for a few attempts. 
To fix this issue, I created the "split" variable to condense some code and it returned the correct word.
For problem 2 and 3, the .py file would only import if I named the file hw7 so I only used that as the name.
The circle function worked as intended and my circle plot never connected, however, when using a handheld calculator, it showed that there were imaginary values near the origin.
Struggled a bit with defining the order_array function, so had to use online sites as resources for examples. The second for loop was what I struggled with; however, it does make sense after running.
Problem 4 was a bit of a struggle as well, but I found how to properly program the mean and max values without using numpy. However, as explained in class, numpy is always the most efficient way opposed to the for loops.

Created the Hw 8 folder and began my log. 
I created the function for Question 1 and tested it out--it ran smoothly!
All of my values were super close to the actual value which make it difficult to see in the graph
To fix this, I changed the size of the dot to make them larger and visible. 
I then created the class for Question 2 and I did not have any issues with creating the functions!
I ran three test cases for the numbers given and everything worked smoothly.

Created the Hw 9 folder and began my log. 
Worked on problem 1. Parts A and C were pretty simple for me to figure out.
Parts B and D took a bit to code correctly. Had to debug with lots of printing statements.
At first, the participants were listed correctly, but the times were not list correctly at all. 
My first mistake was dividing by 3600 instead of multiplying. Once I fixed that error, the correct values were printing. 
I struggled a bit with the second function in the for loop. I needed to create one in order to get the same values for each A and D. 
Began Question 2! I struggled with understanding the circuit concept at first so I needed to review formulas.
Did not have much trouble with creating the function. I added an else statement that prints to change the input if series or parallel is not typed.
Began Question 3! Did not struggle with the function. 
I did need to take some time to make the graph. While it did print out 3D, my line was a flat parabola which did not feel right. 
I posted on YellowDig about advice and someone commented with a great suggested that improved my graph! 
I then saved the graph and prepped my folder to zip for submission.
