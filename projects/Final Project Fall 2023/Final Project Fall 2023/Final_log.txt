Continued this log for Homework 2. 
Took a screenshot of Jupyter after downloading the Anaconda installation from class Tuesday, August 29. My Jupyter Notebook currently runs Python version 3.
I also took a screenshot of my Github desktop 
Problem 2: 
The dog loves eating food; his owner; and other dogs,
The dog loves eating his owner and other dogs. 
Natural languages, contrary to programming languages, are far more susceptible to evolution and change with usage. 
Programming languages, while still may be susceptible to evolution and change, are often determined by few programmers to remain unambigious.
Furthermore, natural languages have tons of rules for binding pronouns and often make statments abstract, which programming language strives to avoid. 
Problem 3:
Completed the Hello World tutorial on Github, too screenshots and saved to folder.

Reopened this log to work on the third homework assignment. Set up a repository within the class folder to complete the assignment.
Created the Jupyter log and completed problems 1 - 3. 
As I pushed origin in Github, an extra folder was created within my homework 3 folder. It was a test_git folder where there is a file that is a duplicate of my homework 3 file.
The extra file was a "checkpoint" file. When I first went to commit changes, there was a warning message pertaining the survey log; however, I chose to do it anyways and that's how the checkpoint file came to be.
Created a Zipfile with screenshots and log to submit for the assignment.

Opened a new file in Jupyter and created a separate file called "acceleration.py"
Struggled with loading the separate file into the homework 4 doc
Ran the acceleration function in a not separate file and the code worked, just had issues with importing it
After lots of trial and error, my function ended up working!
Tested my numbers with this website: https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/acceleration
Pushed my files on GitHub and created a zip file to submit!
*****OUT: Wed Sept 20 3:50:56 EST 2023
*****IN: Tues Sept 26 10:30:45 EST 2023
Created new file and pushed it from origin.
Created a function to solve for roots using the quadratic formula, tested it using an online calculator to confirm results.
Struggled with inputting list values for question 2
Created a displacement funciton that ran smoothly!
Double checked values using: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/displacement_v_a_t.php

Created the Homework 6 folder and kernel. 
Completed Problem 1 and created a graph. Struggled with adjusting the size of the line. 
Completed Problem 2. Bright was not one of the words featured in the question so did not include it in my code. 
Defined the dictionary for problem 3. 
Pushed on GitHub to origin!

Created the Homework 7 folder and kernel.
Using the previous lecture, found an example similar to the for loop for part 1 of problem 1.
Struggled with formatting the while loop for a bit. The code kept returning "developer" for a few attempts. 
To fix this issue, I created the "split" variable to condense some code and it returned the correct word.
For problem 2 and 3, the .py file would only import if I named the file hw7 so I only used that as the name.
The circle function worked as intended and my circle plot never connected, however, when using a handheld calculator, it showed that there were imaginary values near the origin.
Struggled a bit with defining the order_array function, so had to use online sites as resources for examples. The second for loop was what I struggled with; however, it does make sense after running.
Problem 4 was a bit of a struggle as well, but I found how to properly program the mean and max values without using numpy. However, as explained in class, numpy is always the most efficient way opposed to the for loops.

Created the Hw 8 folder and began my log. 
I created the function for Question 1 and tested it out--it ran smoothly!
All of my values were super close to the actual value which make it difficult to see in the graph
To fix this, I changed the size of the dot to make them larger and visible. 
I then created the class for Question 2 and I did not have any issues with creating the functions!
I ran three test cases for the numbers given and everything worked smoothly.

Created the Hw 9 folder and began my log. 
Worked on problem 1. Parts A and C were pretty simple for me to figure out.
Parts B and D took a bit to code correctly. Had to debug with lots of printing statements.
At first, the participants were listed correctly, but the times were not list correctly at all. 
My first mistake was dividing by 3600 instead of multiplying. Once I fixed that error, the correct values were printing. 
I struggled a bit with the second function in the for loop. I needed to create one in order to get the same values for each A and D. 
Began Question 2! I struggled with understanding the circuit concept at first so I needed to review formulas.
Did not have much trouble with creating the function. I added an else statement that prints to change the input if series or parallel is not typed.
Began Question 3! Did not struggle with the function. 
I did need to take some time to make the graph. While it did print out 3D, my line was a flat parabola which did not feel right. 
I posted on YellowDig about advice and someone commented with a great suggested that improved my graph! 
I then saved the graph and prepped my folder to zip for submission.

Created the Hw 10 folder and began my log.
Worked on Question 1 to create a model for the data. The initial guess for each parameter was 1
Imported scipy.optimize for the curve_fit function and matplotlib.pyplot for the plt function. 
Created a curve fit to extract the best-fit parameters given the bounds [0.1, 0.1], [10,15]
Printed the best fit parameters with decimals rounded. 
Printed the equation in y = ax + b form and produced a plot to show that the data is the best fit. 
Worked on Question 2, part b: 
Did not struggle too much with part b. Had to fix distance function a few times because kept organizaing it wrong.
For Part c, I struggled with indentations for far longer than need be. I did not realize I had incorrectly indented my elif statment and adjusted it a bunch of times.
For Part D, I struggled a bit with the for loop since it was complex and I kept mixing up the appropriate indicies. 
Example 1 raises an error, example 2 prints out fine, and example 3 required me to reformat C2 in order to multiply. 
Added my code to github and prepped my zip folder for submission for later tonight.

Unzipped the file and began working on my final project. 
Began working on number 1 so that each letter of the alphabet will convert to a number. The displayed set of numbers spelled out "TICK TOCK TICK TOCK TIME IS RUNNING OUT"
Did not successfully find a way to print the phrase with spaces in between each word.
Began working on number 3. Imported the file and the countour plot displayed a number 3. set clock code = 3 and made that the first integer in the key code.
The next question had a countour plot that printed out the phrase "look up" which led to the next clue. 
It took me a bit to calculate the muahaha count as I originally changed the lower case and upper case and it gave me more than needed. After fixing that error, I found the second number is 7!
Set the 7 equal to muahaha count and added it to the end of my key code
For question 5, I added a line to the previous function to read the last line of the book which asked me to count the number of ones, twos, threes, and sevens.
To find the next number, I divided the total number of ones by the total number of sevens and added it to the total number of twos divided by the total number of threes. 
The answer resulted in 8.691033...which I converted to an integer, set equal to equation_result and added to the end of the key code.
Next, I used the holograph data and set each column equal to x1, y1, z1.
After printing the graph, it formed into a tornado swirl which led me to problem 7.
For problem seven, the year the painting was created was 1665, meaning the sum of all the numbers was 18.
For part a, we took the mean, median, and trace of the data and the trace matched the sum of all the numbers. Therefore, u was set equal to 3.
Part b took me some time to fully understand. It took a long time to convert the velocity semi-amplitude formula to solve for mass_planet. 
Because of this, my data either ran as Pluto or None, which was incorrect at the end. Based on the numbers, I knew the data was closer to Saturn.
I decided to run a for loop to try and match the closest planet to the data I was printing. My code kept outputting Uranus and I could not get it to run Saturn. 
However, when I did N/u and converted the result to an integer (puzzle), the number ended up being 2 which was the correct value. 
Moving on to Problem 8, I first fixed the radius 1 running twice. Furthermore, there were many label errors made throughout the code (where radius1 would be placed instead of radius2, etc.)
So ran until no more errors were present and all labels fixed. The result ended up being 25 m/s making the next two numbers: 2, 5
After this problem, I took a break fro the day. 
******OUT: Mon, Dec 4: 6:02:57 p.m.
******IN: Tues, Dec 5: 12:32:18 p.m.
Began working on the code again! Restarted the kernel to test if all the code is still running as required. 
Began working on question 9
Tried to do a shortcut for making the errays and ended up backfiring as the website I used didn't properly do so. I had differing lengths errors frequently.
Went back and sorted by hand for each to be 42 items in length which fixed my code. 
Along with the model functions for each, I created an objective model to be paired with each model to return the sum of the model^2.
Created a for loop for both models to test which model best fits the data. I had a bit of errors at first because distance and time were not equal due to my typos. 
After the for loops, I created an if-else statement to determine if model 1 or 2 best fit the data and the result was model 2 with the parameter being -4.
Taking the absolute value and the integer, our next number was saved as speed_code and added to the end of key_code.
Moving along to the last number for question 10, I added a couple of scipy function to assist with counting the peaks of the data set.
Calculated the periods through np.diff of the peak_indices value and then took the mean of that value as the last number in the key code (that being 9).
After testing it out, the key code worked and opened the file! 
For question 11, I really struggled with opening the file in the code as it was just causing so many errors. So I ultimately commented it out and including a print statement that described was the pdf was.
Question 12 was addressed by creating this log! Thank you for the great semester, I learned so much about Python, which used to be intimidating to me.
